## 🛡 Security Considerations

- Vote validation (no voting on own comment)
- Server-side enforcement of room state
- Duplicate player/session protection
- Player moderation (admin-only controls)

- [x] Admin + player room logic
- [x] Comment + voting phase
- [x] Scoring and round loop
- [ ] Game mode system
